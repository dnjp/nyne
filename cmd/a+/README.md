Usage of a+:
	|a+
```

`a+` and `a-` use your indentation settings to indent or unindent
your selection in acme using either tabs or spaces depending on
what is configured. To use these commands, write `|a+` or `|a-` to
the scratch area in your acme window, select the text you want to
indent, and then middle click on `|a+` to indent or `|a-` to unindent
your selection. These commands are also used by `nynetab` for
indenting/unindenting text depending on the provided flags.
