# com

Comments/uncomments piped text

```
Usage of com:
	|com
```

`com` uses the `commentstyle` you've configured a given file extension to
comment or uncomment a given selection in acme. Just as with `a+` or `a-`, you
can use `com` by writing `|com` to your scratch area, selecting the text you
want to un/comment, and then middle click on `|com` to execute the command.
